#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run.sh — `swift run` wrapper that stages mlx.metallib alongside the
# Gargantua binary so any MLX-touching UI (Explain button, etc.) can
# actually init Metal without crashing.
#
# Note: as of the BuildMetallibPlugin SwiftPM plugin attached to the
# Gargantua target, plain `swift run Gargantua` also stages the metallib —
# the plugin runs build-metallib.sh as a prebuild command and the runtime
# `MetallibStager` copies it next to the binary at launch. This wrapper is
# retained as a defense-in-depth path and for anyone who prefers an
# explicit, scripted pre-step.
#
# Why the staging exists at all: `swift run` launches the executable from
# `.build/<arch>/<config>/Gargantua`, and mlx-swift's runtime looks for a
# colocated `mlx.metallib` at that path first. The release pipeline stages
# this via `Scripts/release/build.sh`. Without it, MLXInferenceEngine.load
# aborts inside MLX C++ with "Failed to load the default metallib" — an
# un-catchable crash from the Swift side.
#
# This wrapper:
#   1. Runs `swift package resolve` (if needed) so the mlx-swift shader
#      sources are present under .build/checkouts/.
#   2. Does an incremental `swift build` so the binary directory exists.
#   3. Calls Scripts/build-metallib.sh to compile mlx.metallib into the
#      same directory as the Gargantua binary.
#   4. Exec's `swift run Gargantua "$@"` so any additional args flow through.
#
# Mirrors `Scripts/test.sh`'s strategy. Use this (or a similar pre-step in
# Xcode's scheme) whenever launching the app locally for AI testing.
