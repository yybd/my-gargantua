/// Sequential multi-adapter scan pipeline.
///
/// Composes `ScanAdapter` conformers (`NativeScanAdapter`, `CzkawkaAdapter`,
/// `FclonesAdapter`, …) into a single `ScanAdapter` facade so views can treat
/// "the scan engine" as one opaque adapter regardless of how many backends
/// feed it.
///
/// Adapters are invoked in the order supplied and awaited one at a time to
/// satisfy PRD §8.4 "Sequential pipeline by default — never run fclones +
/// czkawka + native scanner simultaneously". `ScanEngine` never uses
/// `async let` or a `TaskGroup`; parallelism across adapters is an explicit
/// non-goal here.
///
/// Results from every adapter are concatenated in adapter order. Each adapter
/// is responsible for its own Trust Layer defaults — `ScanEngine` does not
/// re-classify results, so duplicate review-by-default semantics from
/// `FclonesAdapter` carry through unchanged.
