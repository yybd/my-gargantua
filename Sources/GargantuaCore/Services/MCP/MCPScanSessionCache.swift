// Scan-session cache for resolving MCP `clean` inputs back to the concrete
// `ScanResult` values they refer to. The MCP `clean` tool receives item IDs
// (strings) that the caller pulled from a prior `scan` response; the handler
// needs the full `ScanResult` to route the cleanup to `CleanupEngine` and to
// consult each item's `safety` for the protected-hard-reject guardrail.
//
// Semantics: last-scan-wins. Every successful scan replaces the cache in one
// atomic step, so `clean` always resolves against the most recent scan. A
// prior scan's IDs become invalid the moment a newer scan lands, which makes
// stale-ID bugs surface loudly as `invalidParams` at the handler boundary
// rather than silently cleaning the wrong item.
//
// A simple NSLock-guarded dictionary is enough: the MCP stdio transport
// processes one request at a time, so contention is nil in production. The
// lock exists to keep the scan- and clean-handler code ergonomic (plain
// `func` methods, no actor hops) and to defend against a future transport
// that parallelises request handling.

/// Last-scan-wins cache mapping `ScanResult.id` to the full item.

/// `MCPCleanToolHandler` to resolve the `item_ids` payload into the original
/// `ScanResult` values.
