## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Initial public release.
- YAML-driven cleanup and uninstall rules (19 cleanup files / 83 rules, 2 uninstall files / 12 rules).
- MCP server (`GargantuaMCP`) with Phase 2 read-only tools (`scan`, `analyze`, `status`, `explain`, `list_profiles`) and Phase 3 destructive `clean` tool protected by protected-path hard-reject, 60s-per-client rate limit, audit trail, and cancel-notification grace period.
- Privileged helper (`GargantuaPrivilegedHelper`) for operations requiring elevated trust.
- Local AI explainability via MLX Swift for rule explanations — AI can explain a rule's safety classification but cannot lower it.
