Follow-up from gargantua-gcf8. Current implementation calls `setpgid` on the child from the parent after `process.run()`, which is inherently racy: a child that forks descendants before the parent's `setpgid` runs will leave those descendants in the parent's group rather than the child's. `Foundation.Process` doesn't expose pre-exec hooks, so closing the race requires replacing (or wrapping) `Foundation.Process` with a direct `posix_spawn` call using `POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP`.

Scope:
- [ ] Wrap `posix_spawn` in a minimal Swift helper that matches `DefaultProcessRunner`'s needs (exec + args + pipes)
- [ ] Migrate `DefaultProcessRunner.run` to the helper, preserving existing timeout/drain/escalation behavior
- [ ] Remove the post-spawn `setpgid` and its `hasPgid` fallback
- [ ] Keep (or update) existing integration tests; they should continue to pass
- [ ] Consider whether the same pattern belongs in a shared `ProcessSpawner` primitive
