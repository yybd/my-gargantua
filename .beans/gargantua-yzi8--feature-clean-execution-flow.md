Confirmation modal → Trash-based cleanup → post-clean summary. The highest-trust moment in the app.

## Goals
- Confirmation modal lists exact items, total size, method (Trash vs delete)
- Cancel is visually dominant escape route; destructive button uses --protected color
- Post-clean summary shows freed space and audit trail link
- Confirmation tiers: single button for all-safe, summary dialog for mixed, full modal for protected

## Scope
**In Scope:** Confirmation modal, Trash execution, audit trail integration, post-clean summary, confirmation tier routing
**Out of Scope:** Direct delete option (Trash-first for Phase 1)
