PermissionChecker service exists but isn't used in PermissionRequestFlowView. The onboarding flow should use it to check actual FDA/Automation permission status instead of just marking onboarding complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] PermissionRequestFlowView uses PermissionChecker to verify FDA status
- [x] Permission status shown as granted/denied with visual indicator
- [x] If permissions already granted, flow can be skipped
- [x] PermissionBannerView shown in main UI when FDA is missing (post-onboarding)
