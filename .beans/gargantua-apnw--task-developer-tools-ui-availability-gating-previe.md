Surface Homebrew/Docker controls in UI only when DeveloperToolPreviewAdapter.availability() reports installed. Render dry-run previews via preview(.homebrew) and preview(.docker) into preview panes with reclaimable sizes. Preserve multi-word Docker types (e.g. 'Build Cache'). No execute path yet — destructive ops are Phase 3 behind Trust Layer confirmation. Reference: Sources/GargantuaCore/Views/, DeveloperToolPreviewAdapter.swift.
