When user clicks Clean in ScanBucketListView (onClean callback), show ConfirmationModalView with appropriate tier based on item count and safety levels. Currently onClean is a no-op closure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] onClean in DeepCleanView and DevArtifactScanView triggers ConfirmationModalView
- [ ] Tier selection: 1 safe item → Tier 1, multiple items → Tier 2, any review items → Tier 3
- [ ] Confirmation proceeds to CleanupEngine execution
- [ ] Cancel dismisses modal without action
