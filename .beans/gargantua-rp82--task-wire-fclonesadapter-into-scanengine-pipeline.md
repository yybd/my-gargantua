Compose FclonesAdapter alongside NativeScanAdapter/CzkawkaAdapter in a multi-adapter scan pipeline so duplicate results surface through ScanEngine. Respect PRD §5 sequential pipeline rule (never run fclones + czkawka + native simultaneously). Keep duplicate results review-by-default. Blocked-by: gargantua-i1ii (adapter shipped). Reference: Sources/GargantuaCore/Services/ScanAdapter.swift, FclonesAdapter.swift.
