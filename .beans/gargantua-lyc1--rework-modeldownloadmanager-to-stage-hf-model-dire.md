## Context

`gargantua-mgqr` implemented `MLXInferenceEngine` against a local HF-layout directory containing `config.json` + `tokenizer.json` + `*.safetensors`. But `ModelDownloadManager.defaultModel` still downloads a single `gargantua-q4.mlx` file. The two halves don't connect — the in-app UI download flow produces a file the engine can't use.

Integration-test verified path today: a manually-downloaded `mlx-community/SmolLM-135M-Instruct-4bit` directory, pointed at via `GARGANTUA_MLX_MODEL_DIR`. That works for local dev but not for shipped users.

## Scope

Rework `ModelDownloadManager` to:

1. Download a `ModelInfo`-configured set of files (manifest-driven) instead of one opaque blob.
2. Verify each file's SHA-256 against a pinned manifest (follow the `Scripts/vendored-bins.lock` pattern from `gargantua-vzuz`).
3. Stage them into `~/Library/Application Support/Gargantua/models/<model-id>/` as a directory.
4. `ModelState.downloaded(path:size:)` reports the directory path; `size` is the sum of the staged files.
5. `LocalAIService.explain` passes that directory path as `modelPath` into the engine — no engine changes needed (engine already accepts either a dir or a file whose parent is a dir).

Alternative for a smaller v1: download a single `.zip` / `.tar.gz` from a pinned URL and extract on first use. Cheaper to implement but harder to version-pin individual files. Recommend the multi-file path — mirrors HF's own layout and keeps us compatible with `huggingface-cli download` smoke tests.

## Pinned model target

`mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit` per PRD §6.2 and the xuz6 design doc. Files: `config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, `special_tokens_map.json`, `model.safetensors`. Total ~0.8 GB.

## Out of scope

- Engine changes (mgqr already handles a directory path).
- UI redesign beyond the file-vs-directory label shift.
- Multiple-model support / hot-swap UI (separate bean if we want it).
- Background resumable downloads (current URLSession handles this already).

## Acceptance

- [x] Default `ModelInfo` targets a directory of HF files with SHA-256 pins
- [x] `startDownload()` fetches all files, verifies each SHA, fails cleanly on any mismatch
- [x] `state = .downloaded` exposes the directory path; `LocalAIService` passes it to `MLXInferenceEngine.load` without changes
- [ ] App-level smoke: user clicks "Download model" in settings → model staged → one `explain` call produces AI-generated text
- [x] Docs updated in `docs/designs/2026-04-20-mlx-backend.md` noting the directory-staging reality
